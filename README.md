# Test-Simulator
Simulates the average score of a randomly generated 30-question MC test, taken blindly, 1,000 times. 

## Why Simulate a 30-Question Test?
I gave my students a 30 question test, and some of them scored below 5.
I wanted to see if they would get better results if they took the test blindly.
Turns out, they would have scored better if they did not read the test.
